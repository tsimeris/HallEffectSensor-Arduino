# HallEffectSensor-Arduino
A simple program written in Arduino which I used to poll a Hall effect sensor connected to an Arduino board. The Hall effect sensor values are sent to the serial port.

This is one of a suite of programs that I developed throughout my PhD. You can read more about my research here: http://tsimeris.com/
